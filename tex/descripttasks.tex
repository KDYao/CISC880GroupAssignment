\section{Description of tasks}
In this section, we aim to cater to the two fundamental questions prevalent in Q\&A sites, i.e. predicting the long-term value of the question and predicting whether a question has been adequately answered. This is done by comparing performance gains for different features used to predict the individual tasks.
\subsection{Predicting long-term value of a question}
Q\&A sites serve as an information warehouse providing long term information to multiple users and viewers. Questions with a long-lasting value attract a lot a community attention. The early signs displayed by a question are adequate to demonstrate its long-term effects. A question as a ‘fast’ phase when it will gather community attention and a ‘slow’ phase where it will present its long-term value to the community. With more page views, the value if a question is high, as more people refer to the question for information gain.
\subsection{Predicting whether a question has been sufficiently answered}
The second task focuses on those questions which have not been sufficiently answered and turn them into valuable resources. A questioner decides to offer bounties on a question, he feels is inadequately answered. On the other hand, questioner accepts an answer when he is convinced with the response. This phenomenon is further explored with predicting whether a question will be answered in task 2.
